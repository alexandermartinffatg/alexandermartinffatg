- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex Martin, aka @alexandermartinffatg; I work at Unity Technologies (unity3d.com).
- 👀 I’m interested in making almost anything physical or digital. I love comic art, 3D printing, woodwork, welding, electronics, programming (apps, web, back-end). I'm also a keen mountain biker and have created my own bike frames (with varying degrees of success).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GoLang + ProtoBuf.
- 💞️ In my spare time I’m looking to collaborate on building 3D games in Unity. I'd also love to help anyone with Maker projects.
